## The Problem
In the Web3 creator economy, accepting public donations generally means doxxing your wallet details.
- **Public Donations**: Placing a SOL address in a bio reveals the balance, trade history, and net worth.
- **The "Anon" Dilemma**: Privacy-focused users can't accept tips because it links their persona to their financial identity.
- **Existing Tools**: Current solutions (Blink generators, tip jars) offer zero on-chain privacy.

## The Solution
**Stealth Link** (e.g., `stealth.link/donate/ariel.stealth`) acts as a native Blink on Twitter/X, bridging the viral distribution of Solana Blinks with the privacy of Light Protocol.

When a supporter donates:

1. **Frontend**: The Blink constructs a transaction utilizing **Light Protocol**.
2. **On-Chain**: SOL is shielded (compressed) into a private UTXO owned by the creator.
3. **Result**: Explorers show `Donor → Light Protocol Pool`. The creator's personal wallet never receives a public transfer.

The creator enables funds management via a private Dashboard where they can view their shielded balance and unshield (withdraw) to any fresh wallet when needed—breaking the on-chain link completely.

## Architecture

We built a three-layered architecture to handle the privacy flow:

1. **Twitter/X Integation**: A Blink preview that unfurls for easy donation.
2. **Stealth Link API**: Resolves `.stealth` handles and generates the shielding transaction.
3. **Light Protocol (ZK Compression)**: The core layer that compresses the SOL into a shielded state.

## Technical Implementation

### Shielding (Receiving Donations)
When a donation occurs, we use the `LightSystemProgram` to compress the asset:

```typescript
// Blink API constructs this transaction
const ix = await LightSystemProgram.compress({
  payer: donorPubkey,
  toAddress: creatorPubkey, // Encrypted destination
  lamports: amountLamports,
  outputStateTree: stateTree,
});
```

This ensures the SOL enters the compression pool, and the creator receives ownership of a compressed account invisible to standard explorers.

### Unshielding (Withdrawing)
To withdraw, we query the compressed accounts and decompress them to a new destination:

```typescript
// Fetch creator's compressed accounts via Helius ZK-RPC
const accounts = await rpc.getCompressedAccountsByOwner(creatorPubkey);

// Decompress to any destination (fresh wallet for max privacy)
const ix = await LightSystemProgram.decompress({
  payer: creatorPubkey,
  toAddress: destinationPubkey, 
  lamports: totalBalance,
  inputCompressedAccounts: accounts,
});
```

## Tech Stack
- **[Light Protocol](https://lightprotocol.com)**: For ZK compression and privacy.
- **[Solana Blinks](https://docs.dialect.to)**: For social media integration.
- **[Helius](https://helius.dev)**: For ZK-RPC and high-performance indexing.

This project represents a step forward in making privacy accessible and user-friendly on high-performance blockchains.
