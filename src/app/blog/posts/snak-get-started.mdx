## What Is snaK Wallet?

The **snaK Wallet** is a special plugin for MetaMask (called a Snap) that brings **Kadena (KDA)** support directly into your browser wallet. It allows you to:

- View your Kadena address
- Send and receive $KDA
- Use Kadena apps (dApps)
- Access free test tokens for experimentation

## Why Use It?

- ✅ Use Kadena in the wallet you already trust: MetaMask
- ✅ No new extensions or downloads
- ✅ Beginner-friendly and permission-based
- ✅ Support for testnet and mainnet

## How To Use It

1. **Install MetaMask**
   If you haven’t already, install the [MetaMask Extension](https://metamask.io/).

2. **Connect the Snap**
   Visit the official site and follow the [connect guide](https://docs.mindsend.xyz/user-guide/connect).

3. **Approve Permissions**
   MetaMask will ask for permissions the first time. Approve them to activate the Snap.

4. **Switch Networks (Optional)**
   Want to test things before using real $KDA? You can [switch to testnet](https://docs.mindsend.xyz/user-guide/switch-network) easily.

5. **Get Free Test Tokens**
   Use the [testnet faucet](https://docs.mindsend.xyz/user-guide/faucet) to get some free tokens.

## What's Next?

Once you’re comfortable sending and receiving KDA, you can explore:

- Kadena DeFi apps
- Governance protocols like Kadena Cabinet
- Developer tools and SDKs (if you're technical)

The snaK Wallet is a secure, easy way to get started with Kadena — right from MetaMask.
