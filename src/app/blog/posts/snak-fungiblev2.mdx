We’re excited to announce the first **major post-launch release** of the snaK interface! This update introduces powerful improvements for token management, transaction clarity, and multi-chain usability — making it easier than ever to interact across the Kadena ecosystem.

## What’s New

### Fungible-v2 Support
snaK now supports **all tokens implementing the fungible-v2 interface**. This ensures broader compatibility and gives you more flexibility when managing your assets.

### Chain Abstraction in the UI
We’ve introduced **UI-level chain abstraction**, so you don’t need to worry about the complexity of Kadena’s multi-chain setup. Assets are now easier to track, send, and understand — no more manual chain juggling.

### Enhanced Assets Tab
The new **Assets tab** shows:
- An **aggregated balance across all chains**
- **By-chain details** for balances and deployments, accessible by simply clicking on a token

This means you can view the big picture while still being able to dive deep into chain-specific information.

### Send Flow Improvements
- **Send Modal Enhancements:** A smoother flow for sending all tokens on all chains
- **Send Confirmation Modal:** Review and verify every detail of your transaction before signing, reducing the risk of mistakes

### Transaction List Enhancements
We’ve improved the transaction list with:
- **Token filters**
- **Chain filters**

Making it much easier to track the activity that matters to you.
