We’re excited to announce the first **major post-launch release** of the snaK interface! This update introduces powerful improvements for token management, transaction clarity, and multi-chain usability — making it easier than ever to interact across the Kadena ecosystem.

## What’s New

### Fungible-v2 Support
snaK now supports **all tokens implementing the fungible-v2 interface**. This ensures broader compatibility and gives you more flexibility when managing your assets.

### Chain Abstraction in the UI
We’ve introduced **UI-level chain abstraction**, so you don’t need to worry about the complexity of Kadena’s multi-chain setup. Assets are now easier to track, send, and understand — no more manual chain juggling.

### Enhanced Assets Tab
The new **Assets tab** shows:
- An **aggregated balance across all chains**
- **By-chain details** for balances and deployments, accessible by simply clicking on a token

This means you can view the big picture while still being able to dive deep into chain-specific information.

### Send Flow Improvements
- **Send Modal Enhancements:** A smoother flow for sending all tokens on all chains
- **Send Confirmation Modal:** Review and verify every detail of your transaction before signing, reducing the risk of mistakes

### Transaction List Enhancements
We’ve improved the transaction list with:
- **Token filters**
- **Chain filters**

Making it much easier to track the activity that matters to you.

## What’s Next

We want to acknowledge that there are still some **pending UI bugs**, especially around the transaction list and the cross-chain transaction experience. These are known issues, and we’re actively working on refining them.

Stay tuned for upcoming releases that will continue to improve stability, polish the experience, and unlock even more functionality.

## Final Thoughts

This release is an important step forward for snaK. With fungible-v2 support, chain abstraction, and a more intuitive UI, we’re finally fully compatible with every app in our ecosystem and pushing closer to our vision of making Kadena’s multi-chain architecture seamless and user-friendly.
