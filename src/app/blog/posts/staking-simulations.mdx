## Introduction

Staking is the backbone of decentralized finance protocols like EckoDEX. But how does a staking model that penalizes early withdrawals shape user behavior? In this blog post, we combine math and code to simulate and visualize the EckoDEX staking mechanism.

## Objective

This analysis aims to:

1. **Model the staking mechanics** - Break down the mathematical formulas governing rewards and penalties
2. **Simulate different strategies** - Compare simple staking vs various compounding frequencies
3. **Visualize key relationships** - Show how time, penalties, and returns interact
4. **Quantify tradeoffs** - Measure the opportunity cost of early withdrawals
5. **Optimize returns** - Identify strategies that maximize yield for different time horizons

We'll leverage Python to model how penalties are computed, how compounding changes returns, and how maturity curves affect your net gains. The simulation approach allows us to:

- Test edge cases that would be expensive to try with real funds
- Isolate the impact of individual parameters
- Visualize complex relationships between variables

Let's dive in.

## Understanding the Core Parameters

Before we model the system, we need to define its key components. The EckoDEX staking model uses several important parameters that control:

- Penalty schedules for early withdrawals
- Reward calculation formulas
- Pool dynamics and economics

These parameters create the economic incentives that shape user behavior:

```python
# Days during which principal withdrawals are penalized
AMOUNT_PENALTY_DAYS = 3  

# Penalty multipliers for days 0-2 (3% penalty each day)
PENALIZED_AMOUNTS = [0.97, 0.97, 0.97]  

# Days required to avoid reward penalties
REWARD_PENALTY_DAYS = 60.0  

# Current KDX price in USD for reward calculations  
KDX_USD_PRICE = 0.16  

# Daily staking reward percentage (0.05%)
KDX_STAKING_REWARDS_PERCENTAGE = 0.0005  

# Estimated daily trading volume in USD
POOL_DAILY_USD_VOLUME = 10_000_000.0  

# Total value locked in the staking pool
TOTAL_POOL_USD_AMOUNT = 8_000_000.0  

# Coefficient controlling penalty curve steepness
KDX_COEFFICIENT = 0.66
```

```python
AMOUNT_PENALTY_DAYS = 3
PENALIZED_AMOUNTS = [0.97, 0.97, 0.97]
REWARD_PENALTY_DAYS = 60.0
KDX_USD_PRICE = 0.16
KDX_STAKING_REWARDS_PERCENTAGE = 0.0005
POOL_DAILY_USD_VOLUME = 10_000_000.0
TOTAL_POOL_USD_AMOUNT = 8_000_000.0
KDX_COEFFICIENT = 0.66
````

The `Pool` class encapsulates all key staking pool parameters and behaviors. Each instance represents a unique staking pool with its own:

- **Total staked amount** - The TVL (Total Value Locked) that determines reward distribution
- **Daily volume** - Trading activity that generates protocol fees
- **Reward rate** - The percentage of fees distributed to stakers  
- **Maturity period** - Days required to avoid withdrawal penalties

```python
class Pool:
  def __init__(self, total_amount, daily_swap_volume, staking_rewards, required_days):
    self.total_amount = total_amount       # Total USD value staked
    self.daily_swap_volume = daily_swap_volume  # Protocol trading volume
    self.staking_rewards = staking_rewards # Reward percentage (0.0005 = 0.05%)
    self.required_days = required_days     # Days to avoid penalties (60)
```

This class serves as the foundation for all our simulations, allowing us to model different pool configurations and scenarios.

```python
class Pool:
  def __init__(self, total_amount, daily_swap_volume, staking_rewards, required_days):
    self.total_amount = total_amount
    self.daily_swap_volume = daily_swap_volume
    self.staking_rewards = staking_rewards
    self.required_days = required_days
```

## Reward Calculation

The fundamental reward formula captures several key relationships:

<LatexRenderer displayMode>{`r = \\frac{v \\cdot s \\cdot a}{T} \\cdot d`}</LatexRenderer>

where
- $r$ is the unpenalized rewards amount;
- $v$ is the daily swap volume (in USD);
- $s$ represents the staking rewards;
- $a$ represents the staked amount (in USD);
- $d$ represents the number of days THAT AMOUNT was staked;
- $T$ is the total amount staked in the pool (in USD).

This shows rewards scale with:
1. Protocol usage (volume)
2. Your stake's proportion of the pool 
3. Time committed

The Python implementation translates this formula into code while handling edge cases:

```python
def compute_usd_rewards(days, amount, pool):
  # Calculate user's share of the pool
  proportion = amount / pool.total_amount
  
  # Compute daily rewards based on volume and reward rate
  daily_reward = proportion * pool.daily_swap_volume * pool.staking_rewards
  
  # Scale by number of days staked
  return daily_reward * days
```

For KDX-denominated rewards, we simply convert from USD using the current price:

```python
def compute_kdx_rewards(days, amount, pool, kdx_price):
  # Get USD rewards and convert to KDX
  usd_rewards = compute_usd_rewards(days, amount, pool)
  return usd_rewards / kdx_price  # Current KDX price in USD
```

This two-step approach allows us to:
1. Calculate rewards in stable USD terms first
2. Convert to volatile KDX tokens second
3. Easily adjust for price fluctuations

```python
def compute_usd_rewards(days, amount, pool):
  proportion = amount / pool.total_amount
  return proportion * pool.daily_swap_volume * pool.staking_rewards * days
```

We then convert that into KDX:

```python
def compute_kdx_rewards(days, amount, pool, kdx_price):
  return compute_usd_rewards(days, amount, pool) / kdx_price
```

---

## Penalization Logic: Protecting Long-Term Stakers

The penalty system serves two key purposes:
1. Discourage short-term "hit and run" staking
2. Reward long-term committed liquidity

The penalty percentage follows an inverse power curve:

```python
def compute_penalty_percentage(days, pool, coefficient):
  # Calculate remaining days to maturity
  rem = pool.required_days - days
  
  # Apply power curve formula if still in penalty period
  return (rem / pool.required_days) ** coefficient if rem >= 0 else 0.0
```

Key characteristics:
- Starts at 100% penalty on day 0
- Decreases smoothly as maturity approaches
- Drops to 0% after required days (60)
- Coefficient (0.66) controls curve steepness

We then calculate the actual penalty amount:

```python
def compute_usd_rewards_penalty(days, amount, pool, coefficient):
  # Calculate potential rewards
  potential = compute_usd_rewards(days, amount, pool)
  
  # Apply penalty percentage
  return potential * compute_penalty_percentage(days, pool, coefficient)
```

And the KDX equivalent:

```python
def compute_penalized_kdx_rewards(days, amount, pool, coefficient, kdx_price):
  # Get penalized USD amount
  usd_penalty = compute_usd_rewards_penalty(days, amount, pool, coefficient)
  
  # Convert to KDX
  return usd_penalty / kdx_price
```

<LatexRenderer displayMode>{`\\left(\\frac{D-d}{D}\\right)^c`}</LatexRenderer>

```python
def compute_penalty_percentage(days, pool, coefficient):
  rem = pool.required_days - days
  return (rem / pool.required_days) ** coefficient if rem >= 0 else 0.0
```

Then:

```python
def compute_usd_rewards_penalty(days, amount, pool, coefficient):
  return compute_usd_rewards(days, amount, pool) * compute_penalty_percentage(days, pool, coefficient)
```

```python
def compute_penalized_kdx_rewards(days, amount, pool, coefficient, kdx_price):
  return compute_usd_rewards_penalty(days, amount, pool, coefficient) / kdx_price
```

---

## Amount Penalization

```python
def compute_penalized_amount(days, amount):
  import math
  full_days = math.floor(days)
  return PENALIZED_AMOUNTS[full_days] * amount if full_days < AMOUNT_PENALTY_DAYS else amount
```

---

## Net Return Calculation

```python
def compute_net_returns(days, amount, pool):
  return compute_penalized_amount(amount, days) + compute_penalized_kdx_rewards(days, amount, pool, KDX_COEFFICIENT, KDX_USD_PRICE)
```

---

## Waiting Period Adjustments

When a user adds more money to the pool, the new waiting time is calculated by:

<LatexRenderer displayMode>{`\\frac{t\\times n + r\\times p}{n+p}`}</LatexRenderer>

where
- $t$ is the maturing time
- $r$ is the previous waiting time (user position in the penalty curve);
- $p$ is the previous staked amount;
- $n$ is the newly staked amount.

Python implementation:
```python
def update_waiting_period(added_amount, previous_amount, days_to_maturity, pool):
  import math
  return math.ceil((pool.required_days * added_amount + days_to_maturity * previous_amount) / (added_amount + previous_amount))
```

---

## Penalty Curve: Time-Weighted Disincentive

The penalty applied to rewards gradually decreases as stakers approach the required staking duration. This creates a sigmoid-style decay that:

1. Strongly discourages early exits
2. Provides increasing rewards as commitment continues  
3. Approaches zero penalty at full maturity

The mathematical representation uses the formula:

<LatexRenderer displayMode>{`\\Big(\\frac{D-d}{D}\\Big)^c`}</LatexRenderer>

where
- $D$ is the amount of days required to have 0 penalties;
- $d$ is the number of days since the user staked;
- $c > 0$ is an arbitary coefficient.

Note: The user will receive (1 - penalty percentage) of the rewards

![Penalty Curve](/images/blog/staking/penalty_curve.png)

**Key Insights:**
- First 30 days: ~90% penalty (strong lock-in effect)
- Days 30-50: Rapid decrease in penalty
- After day 60: Near-zero penalty (full rewards)

## Modeling User Interaction

The simulation tracks three key metrics over time:
1. **Reward accumulation** - How rewards grow with time
2. **Maturity progression** - How the penalty window decreases
3. **Net returns** - Combining principal and rewards after penalties

```python
def simulate_period(days, inputs, pool):
   d = 0
   no_input_days = 0
   rewards_list = []
   maturity_list = []
   penalized_amounts_list = []
   days_to_maturity = pool.required_days
   amount_penalty_days = AMOUNT_PENALTY_DAYS
   amount = 0
   
   while d <= days:
     # Handle new deposits
     pool.total_amount += inputs[d]
     if inputs[d] > 0 and d >= 1:
       days_to_maturity = update_waiting_period(inputs[d], amount, days_to_maturity, pool)
       amount_penalty_days = AMOUNT_PENALTY_DAYS
       no_input_days = 0
     
     amount += inputs[d]
     no_input_days += 1
     
     # Apply principal penalty if within penalty window
     if no_input_days <= 3:
       penalized_amounts_list.append(0.97 * amount)
     else:
       penalized_amounts_list.append(1.0 * amount)
     
     # Update maturity countdown
     if days_to_maturity > 0:
       days_to_maturity -= 1
     
     d += 1
     rewards_list.append(compute_usd_rewards(1, amount, pool))
     maturity_list.append(days_to_maturity)
   
   return rewards_list, maturity_list, penalized_amounts_list

def compute_cumulative_rewards(rewards_list):
  import numpy as np
  return np.cumsum(rewards_list)
```

Key visualizations from the simulation:

1. **Cumulative Rewards** - Shows linear growth of unpenalized rewards
2. **Days to Maturity** - Tracks the countdown to full rewards
3. **Penalized Rewards** - Shows actual rewards after penalties
4. **Net Returns** - Combines principal and penalized rewards

## Weekly Compounding: Maximizing Returns

Weekly compounding reinvests rewards back into principal every 7 days, creating exponential growth:

```python
def simulate_weekly_compounding_period(days, inputs, pool):
   d = 0
   no_input_days = 0
   rewards_list = []
   maturity_list = []
   penalized_amounts_list = []
   days_to_maturity = pool.required_days
   amount = 0
   
   while d <= days:
     pool.total_amount += inputs[d]
     if inputs[d] > 0 and d >= 1:
       days_to_maturity = update_waiting_period(inputs[d], amount, days_to_maturity, pool)
       no_input_days = 0
     
     amount += inputs[d]
     no_input_days += 1
     
     # Apply principal penalty if within penalty window
     if no_input_days <= AMOUNT_PENALTY_DAYS:
       penalized_amounts_list.append(0.97 * amount)
     else:
       penalized_amounts_list.append(1.0 * amount)
     
     if days_to_maturity > 0:
       days_to_maturity -= 1
     
     d += 1
     rewards_list.append(compute_usd_rewards(1, amount, pool))
     maturity_list.append(days_to_maturity)
     
     # Weekly compounding logic
     if d % 7 == 0:
       # Reinvest last week's rewards
       days_to_maturity = update_waiting_period(
         np.sum(rewards_list[-7:]), 
         amount, 
         days_to_maturity, 
         pool
       )
       amount += np.sum(rewards_list[-7:])
       no_input_days = 0
   
   return rewards_list, maturity_list, penalized_amounts_list
```

Key benefits of weekly compounding:
- Rewards start earning their own rewards
- 11.2% higher returns than simple staking
- Better capital efficiency while maintaining liquidity

## Comparing Compounding Strategies

Different compounding frequencies yield different returns. This comparison shows:

1. **No compounding (0)** - Baseline linear growth
2. **Weekly (7)** - Optimal balance of frequency and gas costs  
3. **Monthly (60)** - Less frequent but still beneficial

```python
def chart_simulations(days, inputs, pool, comps):
  for comp in comps:
    # Simulate each compounding strategy
    reg_c_rewards, reg_c_maturity, _ = simulate_regular_compounding_period(
      days, inputs, pool, comp
    )
    cumulative_rewards = compute_cumulative_rewards(reg_c_rewards)
    
    # Calculate penalized rewards
    penalized_rewards = [
      cumulative_rewards[i] - 
      cumulative_rewards[i] * compute_penalty_percentage(
        60 - reg_c_maturity[i], 
        kdx_pool, 
        KDX_COEFFICIENT
      ) 
      for i in range(len(reg_c_rewards))
    ]
    
    # Plot results
    plt.plot(
      days_list,
      penalized_rewards, 
      label=f"compounding every {comp} days"
    )
  
  plt.xlabel("days")
  plt.ylabel("cumulative penalized rewards")
  plt.legend()
```

Key findings:
- More frequent compounding = higher returns
- Diminishing returns after weekly compounding
- Gas costs may offset benefits of very frequent compounding

## APR/APY Estimation

Calculates annualized returns for different compounding strategies:

```python
def calculate_apr_apy(pool, comps):
  days = 365
  res = {}
  inputs = [0 for _ in range(days + 1)]
  inputs[0] = 1  # Start with $1 stake
  
  for comp in comps:
    # Simulate full year
    rewards, maturity, _ = simulate_regular_compounding_period(
      days, inputs, pool, comp
    )
    cumulative_rewards = compute_cumulative_rewards(rewards)
    
    # Calculate final penalized amount
    final_rewards = cumulative_rewards[-1] * (
      1 - compute_penalty_percentage(
        60 - maturity[-1],
        pool,
        KDX_COEFFICIENT
      )
    )
    
    res[comp] = final_rewards
  
  return res
```

Results show annual returns for:
- No compounding: 22.87% 
- Weekly compounding: 25.64% (+11.2%)
- Monthly compounding: 25.19% (+9.1%)

**Key Takeaways:**
- Weekly compounding (7 days) provides ~11.2% higher returns than no compounding
- Monthly compounding (60 days) provides ~9.1% higher returns than no compounding
- More frequent compounding leads to better returns but requires more transactions


## Economic and Strategic Implications

Our staking simulations reveal important economic dynamics:

**Protocol-Level Effects**
- The penalty curve reduces sell pressure during early staking
- Long-term alignment improves pool stability
- Compounding rewards create positive feedback loops

**Participant Considerations**
1. **Retail Stakers**
   - Weekly compounding optimal for most users
   - Early withdrawals extremely costly
   - Smaller balances benefit from patience

2. **Institutional Participants** 
   - Can optimize compounding schedules
   - Benefit most from volume-based rewards
   - Have resources to monitor maturity

**Systemic Benefits**
- Predictable emission schedules
- Reduced volatility from locked supply
- Sustainable APRs that adjust to market conditions

1. **Time Commitment Matters**  
   The penalty curve creates strong incentives for long-term staking, with rewards increasing dramatically after the halfway point.

2. **Compounding Amplifies Returns**  
   Our simulations show that periodic compounding (weekly vs monthly) can increase net returns by 5-15% over simple staking.

3. **Protocol Alignment**  
   This design aligns user incentives with protocol health - long-term stakers benefit most, creating stickier liquidity.

4. **Strategic Considerations**  
   - Early exits are heavily penalized (both principal and rewards)
   - The optimal compounding frequency depends on your time horizon
   - Pool size and volume directly impact your returns

**Future Research Directions:**
- Modeling dynamic reward rates
- Simulating multiple deposit scenarios
- Analyzing the impact of pool growth over time

For those staking $KDX, understanding these dynamics can help optimize your strategy - whether you're a short-term liquidity provider or long-term protocol supporter.
