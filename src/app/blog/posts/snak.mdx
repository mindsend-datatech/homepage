## What is snaK Wallet?

The **snaK Wallet** is a MetaMask Snap that adds full **Kadena blockchain support** to MetaMask, letting users manage $KDA accounts, sign transactions, switch networks, and interact with testnet faucets — all from the comfort of the world’s most popular wallet interface.

Unlike traditional browser extensions or native wallet apps, MetaMask Snaps are sandboxed plugins that extend MetaMask’s functionality in a permissioned, secure environment.

## Why Kadena Needs a Snap

Kadena operates on a **multi-chain Proof-of-Work** architecture, providing scalability and strong security guarantees. But until now, accessing Kadena through MetaMask wasn’t possible — Kadena doesn’t use Ethereum’s EVM or address format.

The snaK Snap bridges this gap. It introduces:

- Custom key management and chain handling logic
- Kadena-specific RPC and signing flows
- Seamless onboarding for both testnet and mainnet

## Key Features

- 🔐 **Secure Signing**: Supports `kadena_sign_v1` and `kadena_quicksign_v1` natively
- 🔄 **Network Switching**: Easily toggle between `mainnet`, `testnet`, or custom networks
- 🚰 **Testnet Faucet Integration**: Get test KDA without leaving the Snap
- 🔗 **Multi-chain Compatibility**: Interact with all 20 Kadena chains
- 🧰 **Developer-Ready**: Snap-compatible SDK for quick integration

## How It Works

Under the hood, snaK uses a layered architecture:

1. **Snap Runtime** (Isolated): Handles permission requests and message processing
2. **RPC Router**: Listens for Kadena-specific methods and validates payloads
3. **Signature Engine**: Interfaces with MetaMask’s keyring to produce valid Pact-compatible signatures
