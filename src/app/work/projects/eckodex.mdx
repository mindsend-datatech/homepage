## Overview
We developed an adaptive liquidity mining multiplier for eckoDEX that dynamically adjusts rewards based on real-time market conditions. This novel mechanism uses:
- **Stochastic modeling** of asset volatility
- **Pool health metrics** (Volume/TVL ratio)
- **Time-decay factors** for long-term sustainability

The system automatically compensates LPs for impermanent loss while preventing reward over-emission.

## Key Features
- **Self-Adjusting Multiplier**:
  - Sigmoid-based response curve bounded between [0.3, 0.7]
  - Real-time adaptation to:
    - Pool diluted volume (Volume/TVL)
    - Price rate volatility (Δa/b)
    - Time since launch decay factor

- **Impermanent Loss Mitigation**:
  - Compensates 83-97% of IL through optimized KDX rewards
  - Non-linear reward curves prevent gaming

- **Monte Carlo Verified**:
  - 30,000 simulated pool scenarios
  - Validated across KDA/BTC, KDA/ETH, KDA/kFRAX pairs

## Technologies Used
- **Python**:
  - NumPy/Pandas for financial modeling
  - SciPy for sigmoid optimization
  - Stochastic process simulations

- **Pact**:
  - On-chain multiplier logic
  - Verifiable reward calculations

- **TypeScript**:
  - Frontend visualization of multiplier effects
  - Real-time LP dashboard

- **C#**:
  - Backend analytics pipeline
  - Market data processing

## Challenges and Learnings
1. **Volatility Modeling**:
   - Discovered price rate volatility (a/b) more predictive than individual asset volatility
   - Developed novel β-adjustment mechanism for sigmoid response

2. **Simulation Complexity**:
   - Modified Brownian motion to account for:
     - Cross-asset correlations
     - Liquidity depth effects
     - Arbitrageur behavior patterns

3. **Boundary Conditions**:
   - Implemented convex combinations to enforce:
     - Minimum reward floor (0.3x)
     - Maximum reward ceiling (0.7x)
   - Prevented reward cannibalization during high volatility

This project demonstrates how advanced stochastic modeling can create sustainable DeFi incentive mechanisms.
