## Overview
Kadena Cabinet is a governance incentive protocol designed to maximize participation and optimize reward distribution. By leveraging game theory models, the protocol ensures fair and efficient governance participation, becoming the #1 protocol by TVL on the Kadena network.

## Key Features
- **Governance Incentive Mechanism**: A novel reward system that encourages active participation while preventing gaming of the protocol.
- **Algorithmic Game Theory**: Used statistical models to optimize protocol fairness and protocol parameters based on real-world usage patterns.
- **Spot Prediction**: Predicted the usage of governance spots to ensure balanced participation and prevent over-concentration of power.
- **Fair Allocation**: Automatically adjusted incentives based on participation levels to maintain protocol health.

## Technologies Used
- **Pact**: For secure and efficient smart contract logic on Kadena.
- **TypeScript**: Frontend and tooling for protocol interaction.
- **C#**: Backend services for data processing and analytics.
- **Vercel**: Hosting and deployment of the frontend.
- **Git + GitHub**: Version control and CI/CD pipelines.

## Challenges and Learnings
- **Balancing Incentives**: Ensuring rewards were attractive enough to drive participation without being exploitable.
- **Data Accuracy**: Developing reliable models to predict governance spot usage required extensive testing and iteration.
- **Scalability**: Handling high participation volumes without compromising performance.

## Outcome
- **#1 Protocol by TVL on Kadena**: Achieved the highest total value locked in the network, proving the protocol's effectiveness.
- **High Participation Rates**: Successfully incentivized governance participation, leading to a more decentralized and engaged community.
- **Robust and Secure**: No major exploits or issues, thanks to rigorous testing and formal verification in Pact.
