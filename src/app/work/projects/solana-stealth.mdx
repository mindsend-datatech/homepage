## Overview
Solana Stealth brings privacy to the high-speed Solana blockchain. By implementing a stealth address protocol, we allow users to receive tokens without linking their public identity to the transaction. This ensures financial privacy while maintaining the speed and low cost of Solana.

## Key Features
- **Stealth Addresses**:
  - Receiver generates a unique, one-time address for each transaction.
  - Sender encrypts the transaction data, readable only by the receiver.
  - Mathematical decoupling of sender and receiver identities.

- **High Performance**:
  - Optimized for Solana's Sealevel runtime.
  - Sub-second transaction finality.
  - Minimal compute budget usage for maximum throughput.

- **SPL Token Support**:
  - Full compatibility with SPL tokens (USDC, SOL, etc.).
  - Frictionless integration with existing wallets.

## Technologies Used
- **Rust (Anchor Framework)**:
  - Smart contract logic and state management.
  - Secure and audited program architecture.

- **TypeScript / React**:
  - User-friendly frontend for generating stealth addresses.
  - Wallet adapter integration for seamless signing.

- **Elliptic Curve Cryptography**:
  - secp256k1 and ed25519 curve operations for address derivation.
  - Diffie-Hellman key exchange for shared secret generation.

## Challenges and Learnings
1. **On-Chain compute limits**:
   - Creating efficient cryptographic operations within Solana's compute budget was critical.
   - We utilized pre-compiled programs where possible to offload expensive math.

2. **User Experience**:
   - Abstracting the complexity of key management was essential for adoption.
   - We built an intuitive UI that handles the cryptographic heavy lifting in the background.

This project pushed the boundaries of what's possible for privacy on high-performance L1s.
