## Overview
eckoGOV is the democratic foundation of eckoDAO, enabling community-driven governance through transparent role systems, proposal cycles, and treasury management. Designed to evolve with the ecosystem, it balances structure with flexibility to accommodate diverse DAO operations.

## Key Features
- **Hierarchical Role System**: Clear pathways from eckoMEMBER → eckoLEAD → eckoCORE with escalating responsibilities and privileges.
- **Compliance Framework**: Integrated KYC verification tailored to each role level while preserving pseudonymity where possible.
- **Dynamic Governance Cycles**:
  - Proposal epochs with structured discussion → voting → execution phases
  - Template-based proposal creation for standardization
- **Treasury Management**: Transparent processes for funding allocation from the KDX treasury.
- **Community Discourse**: Built-in discussion mechanisms to foster deliberation before on-chain decisions.

## Technologies Used
- **Pact**: For secure, verifiable governance smart contracts on Kadena.
- **TypeScript**: Frontend development for the governance portal.
- **C#**: Backend services handling KYC integration and analytics.
- **Git + GitHub**: Collaborative development and CI/CD pipelines.

## Challenges and Learnings
- **Balancing Decentralization & Compliance**: Designed KYC flows that verify identity without compromising blockchain principles.
- **Proposal Lifecycle Optimization**: Created epoch timings that allow thorough discussion while maintaining decision velocity.
- **Role Transition Mechanics**: Developed smooth permission escalation paths between membership levels.

This project demonstrates how structured on-chain systems can enable truly decentralized organizations to thrive.
