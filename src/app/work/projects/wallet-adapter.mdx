**Overview**

As the Kadena ecosystem matured, multiple wallets emerged—each with their own connection logic, signing formats, and idiosyncrasies. This fragmentation made it cumbersome for dApp developers to integrate more than one wallet, leading to duplicated logic and inconsistent UX.

To address this, we developed a **standardized wallet adapter interface**. Inspired by Web3Modal and other multi-wallet tools, our system abstracts away wallet-specific details through a clean TypeScript interface and unified adapter architecture.

**Key Features**

* **Standardized API:** A single interface for all Kadena wallets
* **Type Safety:** Strict typing ensures reliability
* **Modular Design:** Easily extendable for new wallets
* **Event Hooks:** Listen for network/account changes with ease

**WalletConnect Integration**

WalletConnect posed a unique challenge due to its session-based communication model. We implemented a wrapper provider to align its request format with our adapter interface:

**Developer Experience**

dApps can now support multiple wallets with minimal changes in application logic.

**Technologies Utilized**

* **TypeScript:** Core architecture and interfaces
* **WalletConnect:** Mobile support and QR-based sessions
* **GitHub:** Open-source, community-driven development

**Challenges & Learnings**

* **Aligning APIs:** Each wallet had subtle differences in their JSON-RPC implementation
* **Session State:** Handling reconnects and session expiration across wallets
* **Error Handling:** Designing predictable and consistent error propagation

**Impact**

* **Improved UX:** Users can switch wallets effortlessly
* **Dev Productivity:** One-time integration for all wallets
* **Ecosystem Growth:** Lowers the barrier to entry for new dApp developers

**What’s Next**

* Adding support for MetaMask Snap integration
* Improving mobile onboarding flows
* Building composable React hooks for tighter frontend integration
